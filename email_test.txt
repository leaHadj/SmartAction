Subject: Follow-up on the SmartAction Project Meeting

Hi everyone,

I wanted to summarize the key points from this morning’s meeting about the SmartAction project:

Samy presented the first version of the email summarization module using Hugging Face’s pre-trained models. The results are promising, but the model still needs improvements for long texts.

Jason reported that the current backend API doesn’t yet support asynchronous requests. An update is planned for Monday to integrate FastAPI and improve processing performance.

Briac shared the Streamlit prototype for the user interface, which will allow users to upload an email file and view the generated summary in real time.

Lyes ran some tests on Azure, and it seems the model requires a GPU for optimal performance. We’ll estimate the deployment cost before the end of the week.

The next follow-up meeting will take place next Friday at 10 a.m. Please update your Trello tasks and share any technical issues on Slack (#smartaction-tech).

Thanks,
Julian Fuchs
Project Manager – SmartAction
